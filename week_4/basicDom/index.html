<!--
Use an HTML file with a <p> element that has the ID content.
Write JavaScript to select this element using getElementById.
Create a function that changes its text to "Hello, World!" when a button is clicked. -->

<!-- n this HTML file, we have:

A heading <h1> with the ID "header".
A button with the ID "changeTextButton" that will trigger an action when clicked.
We include the external JavaScript file using the <script src="script.js"></script> tag. Make sure the file path is correct, and the .js file is in the same folder as the HTML file or update the path accordingly.-->
